## Unicontsoft Fiscal Printers Component 2.0

`UcsFP20` is a COM component that can be used to configure and operate fiscal printers that are popular in Bulgaria.

`UcsFP20` implements lowest-level protocols that are supported by the fiscal printers, usually sending native commands directly to the COM port the device is attached to.

`UcsFP20` support ESP/POS protocol for "kitchen" order lists. ESC/POS protocol supports serial and TCP/IP (LAN) connectivity.
