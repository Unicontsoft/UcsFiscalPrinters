' IDeviceProtocol is a common interface implemented by all device protocol handlers. It can be used to access a fiscal
' device independently of the implemented protocol so that the particular protocol selection can be left to be chosen
' by the end-user or as an application configuration option.
'
' If any method return `False` or an exception is raised then `GetLastError` method can be used to retrieve current
' error text and error category as number.
'
' See `PrintReceipt` method of `cFiscalPrinter` class for a complete workflow for printing a receipt or invoice.
'
' Basicly one can start by calling `Init` to open the serial COM port, then `StartReceipt` to specify the type of
' receipt to be printed, followed by multiple calls to `AddPLU` and `AddDiscount` for each product to be printed on the
' receipt, followed by one or multiple calls to `AddPayment` to specify paid amount by payment types and finally
' complete and print the receipt by calling `EndReceipt`.
'
' Also see `PrintReport` method of `cFiscalPrinter` class for a complete workflow for printing a daily or monthly
' fiscal reports.
